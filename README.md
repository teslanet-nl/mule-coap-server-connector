# Mule CoAP connector - CoapServer
![Mule-Coap logo](icons/coap-logo.svg)

Mule CoAP connector is an Anypoint Connector implementation of the [RFC7252 - Constrained Application Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252). 
With it Mule applications become CoAP capable and can communicate with other CoAP capable devices and services, realising Internet of Things solutions (IoT). 

The connector uses Californium, a Java CoAP implementation. More information about Californium and CoAP can be found at:

* [http://www.eclipse.org/californium/](http://www.eclipse.org/californium/)
* [http://coap.technology/](http://coap.technology/).

This component - the CoapServer Connector - is one of three parts of the Mule CoAP package.  
The other two being the CoapClient Connector and the Mule CoAP Commons component . 

The CoapServer Connector adds CoAP server capability to [Mule enterprise service bus](https://www.mulesoft.com/).
With it Mule applications can implement services that can be accessed by clients using the CoAP protocol.
